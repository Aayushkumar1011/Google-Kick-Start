<h2>What is C++ and Its important Features</h2>
<br>
<h4>C++ language is a direct descendant of C programming language with additional features such as<i> type checking, object oriented programming, exception handling etc.</i> You can call it a “better C”. It was developed by <b>Bjarne Stroustrup.</b>
C++ is a general purpose language language, when I say general purpose it simply means that it is designed to be used for developing applications in a wide variety of domains.</h4>

<h2>Features of C++</h2>
<ul>
C++ is fast
Easy to learn
A powerful programming language
Has many built-in functions and operators which can make complex programs easy
Can be compiled on a number of computer platforms
C++ is an object-oriented programming language.
Use of pointer makes it a much more powerful language.
Also largely used in many large-scale projects
</ul>

<h2>Input, Conventions, Keywords, Identifiers in C++</h2>
<b><h3>Whitespace</h3></b>
<br>
In C++, whitespace refers to spaces, tabs and newlines. In some places in our code, whitespace is necessary whereas, in other places, it is just given to improve readability.
<b><h3>Identifiers</h3></b>
<br>
An identifier is the name of any user-defined element.
<b><h3>Keywords</h3></b>
There are some predefined reserved words in C++ which have their special meaning and thus cannot be used as identifiers. These words are called keywords.
